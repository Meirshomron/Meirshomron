I'm Meir, and I love games ðŸ˜„.
I've always had a passion for games since I was young.
My favorite games are notably: Warcraft 1, AOE 2, HOMM 3 and Tribal Wars.
I Started developing mini games as a teenager in Java and Unity and later pursued my passion with a degree in Computer Science.

I've started by uplading some of the projects I did in my degree and continued to add here any notable project that I've afterwards.
